# Border Control

## Game Description

An absurdly strict border checkpoint where you enter as an unwanted alien. You step onto a custom load cell with all your belongings. An RGB LED panel lists ridiculous “prohibited items” one by one and tells you to discard objects of the same weight. The demands get stranger. You discard things until the system lets you pass.
